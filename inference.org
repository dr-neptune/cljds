#+TITLE: Inference

In this chapter, we consider statistical inference: how can we go beyond simply describing the samples of data and instead describe the population from which they were sampled.

* Load and Inspect the Data

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn load-data [file]
  (-> (io/resource file)
      (io/read-dataset :header true
                       :delim \tab)))

;; load the data
(-> (load-data "dwell-times.tsv")
    (i/view))

;; visualize the dwell times
(-> (i/$ :dwell-time (load-data "dwell-times.tsv"))
    (c/histogram :x-label "Dwell Time (s)"
                 :nbins 50)
    (i/view))

;; try it with a log scale
(-> (i/$ :dwell-time (load-data "dwell-times.tsv"))
    (c/histogram :x-label "Dwell Time (s)"
                 :nbins 20)
    (c/set-axis :y (c/log-axis :label "Log Frequency"))
    (i/view))

* The Exponential Distribution

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(let [dwell-times (->> (load-data "dwell-times.tsv")
                       (i/$ :dwell-time))]
  (println "Mean:   " (s/mean dwell-times))
  (println "Median: " (s/median dwell-times))
  (println "SD:     " (s/sd dwell-times)))
